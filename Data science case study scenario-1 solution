To estimate the expected win rate for a bid response at a given price based on the provided table, follow these steps:

### Assumptions:
1. The win rate is defined as the number of winning bids divided by the total number of bids at a given price.
2. The data provided in the table accurately represents the historical outcomes of the auctions.
3. The win rate for each bid price can be calculated using the formula: 
Win Rate= (Number of Wins/Total Number of Bids).

### Data Extraction:
We will extract the number of bids and wins for each bid price from the table.

### Steps:
1. Aggregate the number of bids (events) and wins for each bid price.
2. Calculate the win rate for each bid price.

Here is the table provided in the scenario:

| app | bid_price | win | events |
|-----|-----------|-----|--------|
| A   | 0.01      | 0   | 100000 |
| A   | 0.01      | 1   | 0      |
| A   | 0.1       | 0   | 7000   |
| A   | 0.1       | 1   | 3000   |
| A   | 0.2       | 0   | 8000000|
| A   | 0.2       | 1   | 2000000|
| A   | 0.4       | 0   | 700000 |
| A   | 0.4       | 1   | 300000 |
| A   | 0.5       | 0   | 80000  |
| A   | 0.5       | 1   | 20000  |
| A   | 0.75      | 0   | 7000   |
| A   | 0.75      | 1   | 3000   |
| A   | 1         | 0   | 400    |
| A   | 1         | 1   | 600    |
| A   | 2         | 0   | 30     |
| A   | 2         | 1   | 70     |
| A   | 5         | 0   | 2      |
| A   | 5         | 1   | 8      |
| A   | 9         | 0   | 0      |
| A   | 9         | 1   | 1      |

### Calculation:

For each bid price, we need to:
1. Sum the events for win = 0 and win = 1.
2. Calculate the win rate as the number of wins divided by the total number of bids.

Here is the calculation:

1. **For bid price $0.01:**
   - Total events = 100000 (win=0) + 0 (win=1) = 100000
   - Wins = 0
   - Win Rate = 0 / 100000 = 0%

2. **For bid price $0.1:**
   - Total events = 7000 (win=0) + 3000 (win=1) = 10000
   - Wins = 3000
   - Win Rate = 3000 / 10000 = 30%

3. **For bid price $0.2:**
   - Total events = 8000000 (win=0) + 2000000 (win=1) = 10000000
   - Wins = 2000000
   - Win Rate = 2000000 / 10000000 = 20%

4. **For bid price $0.4:**
   - Total events = 700000 (win=0) + 300000 (win=1) = 1000000
   - Wins = 300000
   - Win Rate = 300000 / 1000000 = 30%

5. **For bid price $0.5:**
   - Total events = 80000 (win=0) + 20000 (win=1) = 100000
   - Wins = 20000
   - Win Rate = 20000 / 100000 = 20%

6. **For bid price $0.75:**
   - Total events = 7000 (win=0) + 3000 (win=1) = 10000
   - Wins = 3000
   - Win Rate = 3000 / 10000 = 30%

7. **For bid price $1:**
   - Total events = 400 (win=0) + 600 (win=1) = 1000
   - Wins = 600
   - Win Rate = 600 / 1000 = 60%

8. **For bid price $2:**
   - Total events = 30 (win=0) + 70 (win=1) = 100
   - Wins = 70
   - Win Rate = 70 / 100 = 70%

9. **For bid price $5:**
   - Total events = 2 (win=0) + 8 (win=1) = 10
   - Wins = 8
   - Win Rate = 8 / 10 = 80%

10. **For bid price $9:**
    - Total events = 0 (win=0) + 1 (win=1) = 1
    - Wins = 1
    - Win Rate = 1 / 1 = 100%

### Summary of Expected Win Rates:

| Bid Price | Win Rate (%) |
|-----------|--------------|
| $0.01     | 0%           |
| $0.1      | 30%          |
| $0.2      | 20%          |
| $0.4      | 30%          |
| $0.5      | 20%          |
| $0.75     | 30%          |
| $1        | 60%          |
| $2        | 70%          |
| $5        | 80%          |
| $9        | 100%         |

These win rates are based on the historical data provided in the table.

We can also use ML model to provide the estimated win rate for a bid response at a given price. Let's say we have good enough data then translate this problem as a regression problem
by considering winrate as output label and bid_price and other attributes(like publisherID, advertiserID) as the features and then we can try using Linear regression or Neural network 
architectures to estimate the win-rate for any given bid_price.
I have created a demo linear regression based model -  https://github.com/shivyshiv/ds-assignment/blob/main/DS-case_stury_scenario_1.ipynb
